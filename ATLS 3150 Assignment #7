    <h1>My Favorite Movie</h1>
    <p>My favorite movie is <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0368891/">National Treasure</a> because it features <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000115/?ref_=tt_ov_st">Nic Cage</a>. I think he is a funny
    actor and I enjoy the plot of the movie because it is an <strong>action</strong> film. It is about a group of people trying to steal the
    Declaration of Independence.</p>
